# Cordova Phoneinfo plugin

**This plugin can be used within a Cordova app to provide info from the device. Currently it works for Android only. I am planning to add iOS support in the future. This plugin can be used for apps for phones *and tablets* even though I clearly named it 'phoneinfo', but be aware that some calls may not work on tablets.**

## Supported information
The plugin currently provides support to retreive the following device information:
* Sim Serial Number
* Software Version
* Phone Number (also known as line1Number)
* IMEI
* MEID
## Installation
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-phoneinfo
```
## Requests
Feel free to contact me with info requests you need, the android SDK offers so many info I wont be able to provide it all at once.
