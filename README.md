# Cordova Phoneinfo plugin

**This plugin can be used within a Cordova app to provide info from the device. Currently it works for Android only. I am planning to add iOS support in the future. This plugin can be used for apps for phones *and tablets* even though I clearly named it 'phoneinfo', but be aware that some calls may work on tablets.**

## Supported information
The plugin currently provides support to retreive the following device information:
* Sim Serial Number
* Software Version
* Phone Number (also known as line1Number)
* IMEI
* MEID
## Installation
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-phoneinfo
```
